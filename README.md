## Overview

What's for dinner? This has always been the ultimate question. This web application
will help you determine an answer by providing random options of Colonial fare, and
old American standards. So toss out that old recipe book and click "Let's Cook!" to
see what unique culinary masterpiece you will tackle next.


## Functionality

  - Matched comp provided
  - "Add Recipe" button displayed with limited opacity to signify inactive
  - Radio buttons de-activate when one is selected
  - If no radio buttons are selected, and the "Let's Cook!" button is clicked,
  an alert will be given to the user to "Tell us what you are looking for!"
  - Once and option is selected and the "Let's Cook!" button is clicked, a randomly
  generated recipe will be displayed in place of the Cookpot icon on the right
  - If the "Entire Meal" option is selected, a randomly generated full meal option
  will be displayed in place of the Cookpot icon on the right
  - When a recipe is displayed, the "Let's Cook!" button is deactivated, and indicated
  as such with a limited opacity
  - When a recipe is displayed, an additional button will be displayed
  - The "Clear" button will reactivate the "Let's Cook!" and radio buttons on the left
